            This is a unique writeup in the sense that the game itself is just a
            story, something I'm constructing in a data format digestible by the
            game engine, which is the actual coding project component of this.
            In that sense, the two are very tightly coupled and the writeup on
            the engine can be found
            <u
              ><a
                href="gameEngine.html"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit"

              style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"
            ></span>
            I'll offer a brief overview of the story, but I don't want to go
            into exhaustive detail because there is quite a bit of content.
            Players begin in the northeast, around St. Jeromes (where I went to
            elementary school. Most of the game occurs across locations familiar
            to me from my life). They progress through regions in the following
            order:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>St Jeromes (my elementary school)</li>
            <li>
              Arch Street/lower Chinatown (a cool place to be, and an easy way
              to introduce the bartering system given the already transaction
              oriented nature of this area).
            </li>
            <li>
              Cobbs Creek (the 'safe zone' associated with the Cobbs Creek level
              is in a bookstore I like which <em>is</em> in West Philly, but not
              at all Cobbs Creek or even anywhere near it. But calling the
              location Cobbs Creek allows me to use the creek artistically in
              light of a drought condition impacting this place).
            </li>
            <li>
              Art Museum (similar to the cobbs creek thing, the location was
              chosen mostly because it is a good place to introduce gameplay
              elements which incorporate the player's perception. The art museum
              becomes a House of Leaves esque labarynth).
            </li>
            <li>
              FDR Park (there's not a lot to this. I was writing the story in
              May, and had ridden my bike down that way the day I was thinking
              about locations. It was a nice day and put me in a good mood, so I
              decided to throw the park in as a level).
            </li>
            <li>
              Temple (where I am currently attending school, and around where I
              have historically lived).
            </li>
            <li>
              Port Richmond (just a cool place to hang out. The gameplay here is
              more whimsical than in other regions, particularly the mentally
              harrowing Temple level).
            </li>
            <li>
              Manayunk (in the far future world we see the hills have
              haphazardly collapsed into the Schuylkill River, creating an alien
              landscape of cliffs and crags. The fact that the river is not
              nearly deep or wide enough to accommodate this notwithstanding).
            </li>
            <li>
              City Hall (this is where the Annihilation influence comes in. I
              try to invoke the spire of city hall like the
              <s>tower</s>pit/lighthouse for a surreal ending sequence)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Beyond that, it's a survival adventure game in a far future, loosely
            dystopic world with some D&D influence. It's meant to build towards
            a kind of downer ending, with a number of themes which will become
            clear in that ending. Further updates to this page will occur
            regularly (albeit infrequently) as I build this into actual game
            data.
          </p>
          <h3>Prior to 1/30/25</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Created in JSON the first half of the first region. Progress was
            incredibly slow-going and significantly repetitive, so I broke from
            proper region creation in favor of laying out templates which I can
            use for rooms and adjacencies throughout all levels to reduce the
            repetitive nature of this work. To that end, I created a few
            template houses which can be modified to fit any level, as well as a
            few different sorts of industrial buildings. The idea is that, for
            example, the school might be the industrial building on its own. The
            art museum is just 3 of these industrial buildings put together in a
            sort of 'U' shape.
