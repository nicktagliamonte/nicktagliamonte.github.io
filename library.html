          <h3>Oberview</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            A library implementing common (and some uncommon but interesting)
            data structures in java. The idea here is largely to drill data
            structures in a way that will hopefully improve performance in
            technical interviews, in addition to testing with JUnit, which is a
            practice that I'm not going into this with any experience in. All of
            the higher level or more complex structures will be built using
            simpler structures that I create. For example, the hash table uses
            an instance of my DynamicArray class to store entries.
          </p>

          <h3>Linear</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Major questions that came up during the creation of the linear data
            structures were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Generics: Using <code>Object[]</code> or <code>T[]</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I went with <code>Object[]</code> to avoid excessive
                <code>SuppressWarning(“unchecked”)</code> flags.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Testing: My LinkedList test class was failing one test because of
              an issue which I resolved. The reason wound up being a deleted
              class file, the result of which was the test being run on an old
              version of the LinkedList class.
            </li>
            <li>Array or LinkedList based Deque.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Without an actual use case for this library, there wasn't a
                clearly superior choice between these two. I went with
                LinkedList based on the idea that it was more conceptually
                complex and would therefore be a better fit for what is really
                just a portfolio project. The conceptual complexity had already
                been handled by the LinkedList class itself though, so the Deque
                turned out to be a wrapper over that LinkedList class which was
                very quick to create.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h3>Hashing</h3>
          <h3>2/11/25</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span> The first
            major change from my initial plan was to combine the Separate
            Chaining and Open Addressing implementations of a Hash Table into a
            single class which can differentiate between the two based on
            constructor arguments, but which creates just a simple linear
            probing hash table if nothing else is specified. <br /><br /><span
              style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"
            ></span>
            With the hash function, probing, and searching logic separated out
            to a utility HashFunctions file, the skeleton of this class came
            together quickly. A few put, delete, get, and clear methods. The
            biggest issue to manage was the array resizing logic in
            DynamicArray, which I built this on top of. I found myself having to
            independently track the resizing conditions in both this and the
            DynamicArray class, so that if the DynamicArray automatically
            resizes the hash table will rehash all its elements based on the new
            capacity. With that out of the way though, it was a fairly simple if
            verbose (because of the variety of options r/e collision resolution
            and probing).
          </p>

          <h3>Trees</h3>
          <h3>2/26/25</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span> The first
            time back after a long break during which time I sort of
            nonsensically decided to switch to Gentoo from Windows (really
            jumping into the deep end with that one), I finally have a commit
            with the first tree structure: BST.<br /><br /><span
              style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"
            ></span>
            This was more an exercise in writing recursive methods than anything
            else. Which was helpful at first but became repetitive after the 3rd
            or 4th largely identical one. I question whether I could have
            centralized some of that logic into BinaryTreeNode rather than hold
            it in all these separate methods themselves, but after thinking
            about it for a while I did not see an easy way into that: the things
            that the various methods were looking for and doing were both too
            direct and too disparate from one another for a clear abstraction of
            the process to come to mind for me. For example, deleting a node vs
            traversing and serializing nodes -- even if the recursive steps are
            centralized elsewhere, one needs each node's data to be serialized
            and returned in a list type structure, while the other just removes
            the node itself from the tree itself, and so needs direct access to
            the tree. It's possible that I'm just missing something (and I bet
            the thing I'm missing is really very simple and will seem obvious if
            someone tells me) but for now I have a class which contains a half
            dozen distinct and somewhat verbose recursive methods.
