            A library implementing common (and some uncommon but interesting)
            data structures in java. The idea here is largely to drill data
            structures in a way that will hopefully improve performance in
            technical interviews, in addition to testing with JUnit, which is a
            practice that I'm not going into this with any experience in.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            This is also the first project where I am creating the write up in
            line with creating the program itself, so the rest of this will come
            in the form of regular dated updates.

          <h3>1/31/25</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Today I created the maven project and basic file structure for the
            Java library project, which I'm (somewhat regrettably) calling
            'nickslibrary'. So there are now file stubs for all of the various
            data structures I plan to implement in the coming…weeks? Months?
            Days? The timeline is very much up in the air at the moment, but I'd
            like to knock out this project and the calculator by the end of the
            semester then maybe spend the summer developing something that isn't
            a homework assignment.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            It's very likely that BFS and DFS will be implemented as methods in
            the graph files rather than as separate files.
          </p>
          <h3>2/2/25</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            I realized I forgot to add DynamicArray (main and test) in the
            original file structure, so I added those in. As by far the simplest
            data structure on the list, this is the first one I am creating. I
            started the skeleton of the file, basic methods that I know I'll use
            and a couple of constructors were added as stubs. Users can
            initialize one of my DynamicArrays empty, with a specification of an
            initial capacity, or by declaring the array with some variable
            quantity of objects T. The question of whether to use a generic
            <code>T[]</code> or an <code>Object[]</code> came up, and I went
            with <code>Object[]</code> to avoid excessive
            <code>SuppressWarning(“unchecked”)</code> flags.
          </p>
          <h3>2/5/25</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Work has now been completed on the LinkedList, Array-Based Stack,
            and Linked List based stack. Both stack implementations were
            extremely easy, almost trivial, because the logic for accessing a
            dynamic array or linked list element at a given index (and inserting
            one at that index) already exists in the dynamic array and linked
            list classes themselves. Linked List was probably the most logically
            difficult thing to create, probably because that one class can,
            depending on flags, act as either singly or doubly linked and as
            either circular or non. I wound up finding a flow once it became
            clear that each add, search, or remove operation basically falls
            into the category of 'dealing with an empty list', 'addressing the
            item at the head', 'addressing the item at the tail', and 'other'.
            There are some small optimizations: if you have a doubly linked list
            and want to interact in some way with an element that is at index
            greater than size / 2, it's quicker to start at the tail and
            traverse to the element backwards. If you have a circular list, then
            it's easier to address any index as <code>index % size</code> to
            handle errors, rather than immediately declaring OOB something which
            really is not. <br /><br /><span
              style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"
            ></span>
            Testing, on the other hand, is another story. Half the point of this
            exercise is gaining an understanding of unit tests. Right now I have
            an issue where a certain test was failing, so I made changes to the
            code to resolve it. I think I see what the problem was, and I think
            my fix should work…but the test is still failing with the same
            error. I entered some print statements to get more info than I was
            getting from the test cases, and they are indicating that things are
            working well. I build the stack on top of the arraylist which was
            giving me the error and all THOSE test cases are passing. Somehow, I
            don't really understand why yet, my LinkedListTest.java file seems
            to be testing an old version of the linked list class. So we don't
            have these structures in the books quite yet, but they're getting
            there. By tomorrow this all should be figured out.
          </p>
          <h3>2/7/25</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Today's big addition was the circular queue. I was struck by how
            simple this was to implement, the whole thing plus tests took like
            an hour. Which I think is decent time for all the tests to pass and
            for me to learn what a circular queue is.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            It was quick enough that I went on to at least begin the deque
            implementation. At the moment, I am trying to decide between an
            array based implementation or a linked list based. This being an
            arbitrary library with no expected use-case, I might go with linked
            list just because of it's slightly higher conceptual complexity.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            I wrote that while writing the skeleton of the file, figuring out my
            fields and constructors, and landed on linked list based because of
            the conceptual complexity being higher and there being no other use
            case. Then I spent 10 minutes writing a program that exclusively
            calls methods I already wrote in the linked list class, with no
            local logic at all, so I guess so much for conceptual complexity.
            Anyway, another data structure is in the books, because I did the
            real work a few days ago.
