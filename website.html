          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            This first project was completed months before I had the idea to do
            these further information sections, so this is a somewhat distant
            retrospective on the process and won't hold as much information as,
            for example, the game development project (which is a years-long
            undertaking)
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Going into this project, I had never written a word of HTML or CSS.
            I had only the lowest level of familiarity with vanilla JavaScript,
            barely having written more than hello world. So the exercise here
            became mostly one of picking up understandings of these things while
            falling back heavily on reference material. Which it's fair to say
            is evident in the final product; the CSS is rambling and
            disorganized, the standards for menu sections change and improve
            with added pages, the intricacy of functions develops and increases
            as pages get later and later, even the comment style improves
            palpably.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Development happened page-by-page in the order they appear on the
            navigation bar (index first, then about, projects, resume, etc). I
            tried to bang out one page per day while I had the time, but the
            result of this was that the site developed faster than it should
            have and the code quality is lowered by that fact.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            There was a prominent undercurrent of feature explosion throughout
            the process. It's a static site, but it wasn't enough to just throw
            together some basic, simply styled pages - About had to have some
            skill progress bars. Projects had to be this interactive, filterable
            set of cards with smooth scrolling. Of course, my project ideas then
            had to be broad enough to justify this, so I wound up throwing
            anything at the wall and I'll see what sticks. Dockerized hello
            world? Come on. Each new page had this process, which was kind of
            fun, kind of a headache, and at times only half worked (click on one
            of the pictures under Personal. The slideshow … works. But unless
            you have a goldilocks viewport size, they're badly off center and
            eventually having something that worked superseded having something
            pretty).
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            There were challenges throughout the process, and the prominent ones
            have to do with spacing around the projects section and the personal
            page. I had a picture in my head of something like a grid that is
            filled in with variable-height rows, so each new project card starts
            some set amount of padding from the one above it regardless of how
            long that card might be. I was consistently running into an issue
            where the grid would either use the same spacing for each column, or
            else split every project into its own column (padded appropriately
            from the div that is above it). The end result sort of achieves the
            vision though! ...Because the end result is 3 flex boxes, side by
            side, each of which just holds a single column of project cards.
            It's easy to make a grid of variable length row heights if you just
            don't make it a grid. It makes upkeep a little bit of a headache
            (column 1 having an item moved to "Under Development" means that the
            top card in column 2 has to move to column 1, the top card of 3 to
            2, and so on.) The pictures caused the same headache, and the
            workaround there is to just put them all at the same aspect ratio so
            that the grid doesn't have to be variable length. it's just a run of
            the mill grid.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            I don't think it's too bad, for a first go at it.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Expansion</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            “Future Expansion” also falls into this same explosive category
            described above. I have fun ideas, expansions, that sort of thing.
            The act of writing this is a function of that - the page that
            brought you here only was introduced months after I moved this
            project into finished, knocked out a game engine, took my finals,
            and wrote a notes app. But really, future expansion would be to make
            the code presentable. It shouldn't count as done until it is done
            right. I'm fine saying that “done right” can mean “done to the best
            capacity I had at the time I took on the project,” but I've gotten
            better at this since having wrapped up the site and I could fix some
            of the shortcomings that currently just have old hacky workarounds.
            I could organize the CSS and remove conflicting or deprecated rules.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            I talked at one point about taking this out of github.io and hosting
            it elsewhere, giving it a custom domain, incorporating a backend.
            There isn't a lot of functional reason to do that, and there is
            obvious if minor financial detriment to it, so that probably won't
            happen. It could be nice, though, to have this as a demo platform
            for some of my other web apps. It isn't a far jump to make the game
            engine run on web rather than terminal, the notes app certainly
            would become demonstrable. Perhaps, at some point, it's something
            I'd take on.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Also, it's a massive jump to make the game engine run as a webapp
            rather than through the terminal. There's no way that's going to
            happen, especially as I've already poured work into getting it
            halfway functional on a terminal.
