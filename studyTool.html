          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Note that this is a tiny program that serves a single tiny function
            adequately, and was written over the course of like 2 hours. This
            project was not originally planned, and kind of came up organically
            while I was working on the final which it pertains to - I just
            wanted something to throw a few practice problems at me that were
            set within a pretty particular set of boundaries, and I was taking a
            class where the assignments were completed in C, so I threw this
            together in C. I polished it somewhat to make it more user friendly
            once I decided that maybe this could count as a project in its own
            right, but otherwise this is a very bare bones thing with few
            expansions and few needs for expansion. It's a small, terminal based
            C program to spit out some practice problems.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Expansion</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            There are not many, and there don't really need to be. This was a
            single function item designed to complete a single function, which
            it did adequately. The use case is extremely narrow - anyone not
            currently preparing for a final exam in Temple CIS 2107 given by Dr.
            Ajaj would have no use for it at all. To that end, I could maybe
            introduce a way to expand the use case and make it a more
            general-purpose study tool by giving the end user the ability to set
            the upper and lower bounds for the problems they are presented with.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            It could be more broadly altered (read: rewritten) to function as a
            web application demonstrable on this site, if I get this site to the
            point where it's not just a static Github.io page, but the same can
            be said for many of the projects listed on the projects page.
