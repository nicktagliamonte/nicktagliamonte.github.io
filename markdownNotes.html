          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            This project was unique in that it represented the first break from
            only building one thing at a time. Honestly, a few months and untold
            hours into the development of the game engine and with the story
            still looming ahead of me, I needed a break and to work on
            <em>anything</em> else. This app is simple, functional, and was a
            good learning experience wrt web development.
          </p>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            The process here was simple: I wanted a web app which would just
            record notes that I wrote, have the option to view those notes
            formatted in markdown, and give me the option for multiple tabs.
            Basically the Windows 11 notes app but online and with a markdown
            preview window. Having gone through some vanilla JS development at
            this point with the github site (and having seen more than a few job
            postings mentioning React which I had not to this point used at
            all), I decided to use React.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Similar to the website itself, that made this a significant exercise
            in using reference material during the development process. But
            having already worked with HTML and CSS, it was a lot easier to put
            the site together from a static perspective.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Divided into a topMenu, tabBar, sideMenu, editorWindow,
            previewWindow, and bottomBar, and combined through App.js, it was
            fairly simple to iterate through and construct those components
            visually, then layer the functionality over top of them. Integrating
            changes made to the side menu (adding or deleting notes, opening new
            notes, renaming notes or pages) with the tabs accessible through the
            tab bar was a challenge, but as I got more comfortable with the idea
            of forward refs and how props and states really function this got
            progressively smoother.
          </p>
          <h3>Hurdles</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span> The major
            one came in the edit window, and barely had anything to do with the
            function of the application itself. My original edit menu contained
            options “find”, “find in notes”, “replace”, and “replace in notes”.
            None of those made it to the finished app. I had modals created for
            all of these components, and they were launching correctly and
            stylized nicely. But the editor is just a simple text area, and I
            struggled to get the found word selected properly. I went pretty far
            down the wrong path working to get editor content 'highlighted', and
            I eventually wound up replacing the simple text area with a div that
            could have style tags passed into it. And so it was that I got the
            find function to work to replace 'text' with
            <span style="background-color: blue; color: white">'text'</span>
            ...but not to just select 'text'.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            After some deliberation, I decided that the find and replace
            functions were not vital to the app functionality and removed the
            edit menu. It was a few days later that I thought of some other edit
            menu based functions that could be nice to include, one of which was
            'select all'. Of course, looking for reference material on
            <em>selecting</em> text in a text area rather than highlighting it
            brought me to the .select() function. Which would have perfectly
            answered my need as it relates to the find and replace functions.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            At this point, the edit menu was getting crowded and I chose not to
            include find and replace functions. The note taking app is targeted
            as a notes and markdown formatting application and I wanted to avoid
            building in too many elements of rich text editors.
            <br /><br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Functions like persistence of notes came easily after the experience
            gained from other projects, and I was happy to see JSON parsing go
            from one of the most significant challenges of a past project to a
            footnote of this one, taken care of with barely a second thought.
            The styling is more organized, the themecontext.js file making
            darkmode and lightmode styles quick and simple without growing into
            the behemoth css sheet that my first webapp had.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Expansion</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            There's not a lot I would change with this one. I could add a find
            function in, obviously the app is bare bones enough that any
            comparison to an actual rich text editor is unwarranted, but I can
            honestly say I'm happy to put a bow on this as-is.
          </p>
