          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em"></span>
            Initially, this was a locally runnable GUI application which
            replicates as closely as possible the TI-30X IIS. It still covers
            the bases of that calculator, but has grown into something
            specialized in number theoretic functions. Much more detail exists
            on this in the 'Points of Pride' section below.
            <br />There wasn't supposed to be much to this one. I have poured a
            lot of work into the last few projects, and I kind of just wanted to
            get something else on the board. Turns out, this calculator I was
            replicating has 45 or so buttons, most with secondary features, and
            a fair few with the function to open a menu with many more options
            contained within.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            Some general Notes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can replace characters from previous cursor positions, but the
              only way to replace the final char is to delete and re-enter it.
              This is an extra button press but saves like 200 lines of code
              between several modules...which is poor design, it certainly
              SHLOULDN'T save 200 lines of code, but that's the way things fell
              and it's not the end of the world.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm very happy with the modulo addition. However, note that it
              does NOT output any data in sci or eng modes. An earlier,
              pre-release version of the calculator did, and I realized that I
              was across the board applying the modulo function to the mantissa,
              stripping the rest, and then just appending x10^0, which felt
              pointless and bloated. I was initially concerned that this might
              be suboptimal for people working with moduli high enough to have
              least positive residues that need to be output in scientific
              notation. However, those isolated and unlikely cases are already
              addressed by the auto-output of the calculator and the number
              length limitation, which automatically converts certain very
              high-magnitude results to scientific notation.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm happy to report cross-platform compatibility. The save/load
              system behaves differently for Windows/Darwin/other (Linux and
              other Unix-like systems) in an appropriate manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some keyboard-potential functions were not included OOB for the
              sake of clarity or avoiding ambiguity:
              <ul>
                <li>e and EE (to keep the hotkeys case-independent)</li>
                <li>
                  Clear maps to CLEAR because using c would impede cos, cl would
                  impede memclr, and clr would impede memclr. So we need the
                  full word.
                </li>
                <li>
                  K was avoided because of collision while in vs. out of the K
                  menu.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some Things the Original Calculator Has Which I Left Out:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I got rid of memvar because rcl adequately addresses its purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              Handling of frequency domain errors is passed to the stat function
              evaluator rather than raising an immediate error. This is because
              my implementation handles stat function calculations in a way that
              makes this order of error notification reasonable from and
              end-user perspective.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some Regrets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It was unwise to commit so hard to recreating a device limited by
              physical space. I don't really need these buttons in general. I
              could have simplified everything by abstracting things to keyboard
              input, dropdown menus, or doing what I did with statistical
              output—rapidly calculating and displaying all relevant
              possibilities for quick analysis. This would have been
              particularly wise for trig functions.
            </li>
            <li>
              I should have removed K. It's a confusing feature that seems
              crafted to be forgotten about and to therefore vex the end user
              with invalid output at best or bizarre syntax errors at worst. At
              least my implementation has detailed error handling and doesn't
              just say "SYNTAX Error."
            </li>
            <li>
              I wanted to add custom hotkeys and user-editable keyword creation.
              For example, pressing s, i, and n in succession adds a sin
              function to input. I thought it would be nice to include a
              2-column table with the bottom row empty and editable, where users
              could enter a key in column 1 and select a calculator button in
              column 2. Before saving the new mapping, the program would check
              for prefix collisions among existing hotkeys. However,
              implementing this required a deep architectural change—moving from
              directly coupling buffer input to functions into creating a key
              mapping dictionary and altering keypress events to data-driven
              functionality. Additionally, some key mappings add input to the
              screen, others alter the calculator state, and still others recall
              values from memory. These cases are handled by different modules
              and require individual consideration in the new approach... it was
              out of scope. While some users might want to remap the spacebar to
              functions like sin, the majority would only use it for adding
              mappings to functions that couldn't be input through the keyboard
              out-of-the-box. If I included such mappings, the majority of use
              cases for my custom implementation would become null, and I
              wouldn't have to refactor so much code. It felt like a win-win,
              but a loss in that a very complex feature was left on the cutting
              room floor. So it goes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some Points of Pride:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Added an ABS function to the calculator. This is a simple
              function, but I have it and TI doesn't.
            </li>
            <li>
              Defaulted to radians instead of degrees (why on earth wouldn't
              you)
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplified keypress sequence to enter a K value, and reduced the
              number of characters possible to enter into K. There's no need to
              put K=R>Pθ at the end of every user function, as this can only
              cause errors. Only menus that return characters valid at the end
              of an expression are valid inserts into K. But it is fair to say
              that I should have just scrapped the feature altogether.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some functions that lead to errors are not addressed—e.g.,
                  adding "sin(" to the end of every function, which is
                  ridiculous. The improvement over the real calculator is
                  present, but there are still cases where having a 'K' menu is
                  unnecessary.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The keypress sequence to input stat data is more user friendly and
              intuitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Technically, my calculator can handle higher values. But my
              calculator is powered by a very large desktop computer and is not
              a handheld device for schoolchildren...
            </li>
            <li>My error messages are FAR more descriptive</li>
            <li>
              My insert mode allows insertion of as many characters as desired,
              until insert is manually turned off.
            </li>
            <li>
              By far the biggest point of pride is the number theory module:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Users will click the 'num' button to enter a menu prompting for
                input of an 'n', a modulus 'm', and an 'a'
              </li>
              <li>'m' and 'a' are optional</li>
              <li>
                The modulus will default to the currently-set mod, but can be
                changed without altering the currently set mod
              </li>
              <li>
                After inputting the various items, they can exit the menu and
                access 'numvar'
              </li>
              <li>
                Very similar to statvar, this will present a list of options
                that will be left/right scrollable

          <ul>
            <li>
              Complex numbers. This didn't really occur to me until after I
              started typing this, but I might now go back and add them in. How
              would that work exactly? I guess I would need to either input a
              complex number state and error out on complex input when not in
              this state. Or maybe just add "+0i" to anything without a complex
              part and evaluate EVERYTHING as complex? Probably the latter, if
              either.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On further thought, I decided against this. I just added a huge
                number theory module, and that feels like a fairly niche
                specialization. Especially given that all of the number theory
                is elementary, it makes more sense not to invoke complex numbers
                calculator-wide.

            <li>
              Advanced functions like the gamma function, Bessel functions,
              Dirac delta function, polynomial manipulation and root-finding
              functions. I skipped it because the labor to payoff ratio was
              bananas.

            <li>
              Calculus functions like derivatives and integrals. I probably
              would need to have restricted the input to a single variable and
              restrict the symbol for that variable to something like 'x' or
              'y'. Then, I would need to implement input buttons and shortcuts
              via keyboard, followed by integrating a symbolic differentiation
              library or write my own algorithm to compute derivatives and
              evaluate integrals numerically. This would require significant
              effort and testing to ensure accuracy and reliability and i
              mean...Wolfram is literally right there, just use that.
